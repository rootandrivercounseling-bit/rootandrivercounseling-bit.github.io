                    <p>I draw from a blend of Internal Family Systems (IFS), somatic therapy, polyvagal theory, mindfulness, and compassion-focused approaches. These frameworks help clients move beyond symptom management and into deeper healing—understanding their parts, strengthening their nervous system, and rebuilding a sense of safety and self-trust.</p>
                    <p>I'm especially helpful for clients navigating trauma, anxiety, depression, anger, ADHD, identity and life transitions, and relationship struggles. I also work well with first responders, men's issues, and individuals who feel disconnected, overwhelmed, or stuck in old patterns. Many of the people I support are looking for a therapist who can go beneath the surface and help them understand why they feel the way they do—and what it takes to truly change.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I recharge by spending time outdoors, playing guitar, lifting weights, running, watching horror movies, and being with my family. I practice in Boise, Idaho, and bring both professional training and lived experience—including my years as a firefighter/EMT—to the work I do. My goal is to offer a grounded, compassionate, and real space where healing feels possible and supported.</p>
